  <p><b>A safe, expression-oriented language with algebraic effects and familiar syntax.</b></p>
  
</div>

**hica** is a safe, expression-oriented language with a functional style and familiar syntax.

Features include:

- Hindley-Milner type inference
- Algebraic effects
- Expression-oriented design
- No nulls or unchecked exceptions
- Compilation to C, JavaScript, and WASM

Under the hood, hica is implemented in [Koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/) and inherits Koka's algebraic effect system and Perceus memory management.

hica stands for **H**indley-Milner **I**nference **C**ompiler with **A**lgebraic effects.

Visit hica's [website](https://www.hica.dev/) for a tour of the language.

## Design Goals

- **Safe by default** – no null, no unhandled exceptions; errors are values (`Result`, `Maybe`).
- **Expression-oriented** – everything returns a value: `if`, `match`, and blocks are all expressions.
- **Functional-first** – immutability by default, higher-order functions, and pattern matching at the core.
- **Minimal ceremony** – Hindley-Milner type inference means you rarely write annotations; the language gets out of your way.
- **Effect tracking** – side effects (I/O, state, exceptions) are tracked by the type system, not buried in function bodies.
- **Predictable memory management** – inherited from Koka's Perceus reference counting; no GC pauses, no manual allocation.
- **Familiar syntax** – curly braces, `let`, `fun`, `match`, `if`, and the `=>` expression-bodied shorthand.

## Built with hica

[**tbdflow-ui**](https://github.com/cladam/tbdflow-ui) — a desktop dashboard for [tbdflow](https://github.com/cladam/tbdflow), a Trunk-Based Development CLI with thousands of downloads and a [listing on trunkbaseddevelopment.com](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/committing-straight-to-the-trunk/#tooling-support). The UI is a multi-panel ImGui app written entirely in hica.

[**hicurl**](https://github.com/cladam/hicurl) — a modern HTTP CLI inspired by the ergonomics of HTTPie and Curlie, built entirely in hica. Features native C execution speed, zero-`jq` JSON response filtering, offline dry-run inspection, and environment-aware routing.

[**hedit**](https://github.com/cladam/hedit) - hedit is a lightweight, terminal-based text editor. It aims to pair modern editor UX (standard keybindings, mouse, multiple cursors, split views) with hica's algebraic effects and Perceus-based memory management (FBIP).

[**HML**](https://github.com/cladam/hml) — hica Markup Language, a structured document and configuration format. The parser and API library are written in hica and published as a reusable package. Demonstrates multi-file libraries, recursive data types, and pattern matching on tree-shaped data.

[**yml2hml**](https://www.hica.dev/docs/yml2hml/) — a standalone CLI tool that converts YAML files to HML format. A practical example of real-world parsing, recursive data structures, and formatted output.

## Concurrency & Actors

hica targets scripting, tooling, and single-threaded programs, but features first-class support for the **Actor Model** and cooperative concurrency via algebraic effects.
With the `actor` keyword and the `"std/actor"` standard library module, you can define, spawn, and interact with stateful actors:

The standard library `"std/actor"` provides helpers to interact with actors:
- `send(state, msg, receive)` — Sends a fire-and-forget message, discarding the returned state.
- `ask(state, msg, receive, project)` — Sends a request message and projects a reply from the updated state.
- `process_messages(state, messages, receive)` — Runs a fold loop to process lists/mailboxes of messages.

### Cooperative Concurrency

Under the hood, actors compile to Koka's algebraic effect handlers. This enables cooperative patterns (coroutines, generators, and interleaved concurrent actors) with single-threaded schedulers without needing complex language-level async/await.

See the following examples for a deep dive:
- [`bank-actor` example](examples/bank-actor.hc) — stateful bank account actors using first-class syntax.
- [`ping-pong-cooperative` example](examples/ping-pong-cooperative.hc) — a concurrent, asynchronous FIFO event-loop scheduler interleaving actors.

For I/O-bound parallelism in the meantime, `exec()` and `exec_args()` let you shell out to external processes.

## Install

### Build from source

Requires [Koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/book.html#install) ≥ 3.2.

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cladam/hica.git
cd hica
make release
```

> **Already cloned without `--recurse-submodules`?**
> Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` inside the repo before building.

## Why hica?

hica aims to combine:

- the readability of Python,
- the safety mindset of Rust,
- the ergonomics of F#,
- and the algebraic effects of Koka,

while keeping a familiar curly-brace syntax.

## Quick Start

Create a file `hello.hc`:

```rust
fun main() {
  println("Hello, world")
}
```

Then run it:

```sh
hica run hello.hc
```

Other common commands:

```sh
# Compile to a binary
hica build hello.hc -o hello

# Type-check without emitting
hica check hello.hc

# Analyse code quality and FP debt
hica analyse hello.hc

# Format source
hica fmt hello.hc
```

## Static Analysis & Quality Engine

hica includes an integrated static analyzer (`hica analyse` or `hica a`) that inspects code post-typechecking for functional anti-patterns, side-effect hygiene, and allocation bottlenecks:

```sh
# Terminal quality report with colored score summaries
hica analyse src/main.hc

# Output Markdown formatted hotspots for AI-assisted refactoring
hica analyse src/main.hc --format markdown --top 1 | genie "Refactor this hotspot"

```

Tracked anti-patterns include:

* **Purity & Effects**: Mixed or heavy side effects (`io`/`fsys` and `console`) in domain functions.
* **Immutability**: Imperative `var` declarations and `for`/`while`/`loop` constructs.
* **Pipelines & Allocations**: Eager list transformation pipelines with >2 operations (recommends `std/stream` or `std/xform`).
* **Error Handling**: Deeply nested `match` expressions on `Maybe`/`Result` (recommends `?` operator or combinators).
* **Double Wrapping**: Returning nested structures like `maybe<maybe<T>>` (recommends `and_then`/`flat_map`).
* **Closure & Lambda Noise**: Redundant wrapper lambdas like `(x) => f(x)` (recommends point-free style).

## Examples

### Expression-bodied functions

```rust
fun double(x) => x * 2

fun main() {
  let result = double(21)
  result
}
```

### Match expressions

```rust
fun describe(x) => match x {
  0 => "zero",
  1 => "one",
  _ => "many"
}
```

### Lambdas

```rust
fun apply(f, x) => f(x)

fun main() {
  let sq = (n) => n * n
  apply(sq, 5)
}
```

### Type annotations

```rust
fun add(a: int, b: int) : int => a + b

fun main() {
  let x: int = 42
  println(add(x, 8))
}
```

### Maybe and Result types

```rust
fun safe_divide(a, b) =>
  if b == 0 { Err("division by zero") }
  else { Ok(a / b) }

fun main() {
  match safe_divide(10, 3) {
    Ok(n)  => println(n),
    Err(e) => println(e)
  }
}
```

### FizzBuzz

```rust
fun fizzbuzz(n) =>
  if n % 15 == 0 { "fizzbuzz" }
  else if n % 3 == 0 { "fizz" }
  else if n % 5 == 0 { "buzz" }
  else { show(n) }
```

### Running hica with a shebang!

By default, running `hica` transpiles to Koka, emits C, and then compiles a native binary. While this produces high-performance native executables, the C compilation step (gcc/clang) adds startup latency that can feel sluggish for lightweight scripts. Users can instead run `hica` code using the JS compiler for instant results (same compiler that powers the Playground and REPL) this is acheivable using a standard shebang on a Linux/Mac environment:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env hica-js

fun main() {
    println("Running quickly with JS engine!")
}
```

Make the hica file executable and run it:
```sh
chmod +x file.hc
./file.hc

# Output
Running quickly with JS engine!
```

## Inspirations

- [Koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/) – language with algebraic effects and
  Perceus memory management
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) – syntax, safety mindset, and the `match` expression
- [F#](https://fsharp.org/) – functional-first style, pipelines, and type inference ergonomics
- [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) – the `=>` expression-bodied shorthand and query syntax
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) – approachable, expressive lists and comprehensions

## Status

hica is under active development and moving fast — new features land regularly and contributions are welcome.

The language is usable today for experimentation and personal projects.

## Compilation Pipeline

```
.hc source → Lex → Parse → Desugar → Type Check → Emit Koka (.kk) → Koka Compiler → C/JS/WASM
```

Each phase is implemented as a Koka module using algebraic effects for compiler
state (diagnostics, fresh type variables, symbol scopes).
